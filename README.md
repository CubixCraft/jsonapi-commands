# [![JSONAPI-Commands](http://i.imgur.com/CtpZF.png)](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/jsonapi-commands/)

**With JSONAPI-Commands you can easily register** ***real***
**ingame commands like `/spawn` or `/tp silvinci Notch`.**  
This is it. No downsides. No quirky hacks. It just works.
You don't even get these pesky `Unknown command` messages.

View the [BukkitDev page](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/jsonapi-commands/).

## Installation

Download the [latest version](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/0pt7rk39y3qgmxt/JSONAPI-Commands.jar?dl=1)
of JSONAPI-Commands and put it in your server's `plugins` directory.
If you haven't already grab the [latest version](http://ci.alecgorge.com/job/JSONAPI/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/JSONAPI.jar)
of JSONAPI and put in the very same directory.

## How it works

JSONAPI-Commands listens on the [`PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent`](http://jd.bukkit.org/doxygen/d4/dbe/classorg_1_1bukkit_1_1event_1_1player_1_1PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent.html), that is fired whenever a player (it has to be a player, console doesn't count) enters a command. As the name suggests it is called *before* any other plugin or Bukkit itself can interfere. This way we can [cancel](http://jd.bukkit.org/doxygen/d9/d37/interfaceorg_1_1bukkit_1_1event_1_1Cancellable.html#ac672af0d6b82d1598c02c8f81b4e06a8) the whole command and noone will ever notice, that in reality the issued command never was officially registered.

## Configuration

JSONAPI-Commands creates a `commands.yml` in the `JSONAPI` folder. This file is pretty self-explanatory.
It contains all registered commands and may be edited by hand. This file survives server reloads and restarts.
This way you're programs don't have to re-register (refer to 'Methods') their commands all the time,
nevertheless I do encourage you to implement checks into your software. You'll never now what can possibly happen.

## How to use it

JSONAPI-Commands introduces new methods and a stream to @alecgorge's *great* [JSONAPI](https://github.com/alecgorge/jsonapi).

### Methods

- `commands.addListener(String command)` registers the given command
- `commands.addListeners(String[] command)` registers the given commands
- `commands.removeListener(String command)` removes the given command
- `commands.removeListeners(String[] command)` removes the given commands
- `commands.removeAllListeners()` removes all listeners *(use with caution!)*
- `commands.allListeners()` returns an array of all registered commands

### Stream

The new stream is named `commands`. This means you can subscribe to it with this URL:
```
/api/2/subscribe?json={"name":"commands","username":"yourName","key":sha256("yourName"+"commands"+"yourPassword"+"yourSalt")}
```
A sample (prettifyed) response for `/tp silvinci Notch` run by the player alecgorge may look like this:
```
{
  "result": "success",
  "source": "commands",
  "success": {
    "time": 1353715957,
    "command": "tp",
    "args": ["silvinci", "Notch"],
    "player": "alecgorge"
  }
}
```

- `time` is the exact timestamp when the command was issued
- `command` is the command issued
- `args` is an array of the arguments concatenated to the command *(no args = empty array)*
- `player` is the player who issued the command *(not the affected player)*

## Examples

... will follow shortly.
